<b> Introduction </b> \
Since 2016 election, U.S. Border security has been a major subject of debate. \
Did the political agenda affect the way people enter our country in both Southern and Nothern borders? \
If not, what drives the number of Border entry to fluctuate? \

<b> Data </b> \
This data is originally collected by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) every quarter. \
Then it gets cleaned, assessed and maintained by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS). \
It contains the statisics for inbound crossings at the U.S.-Canada and the U.S.-Mexico border at the port level for every month from the beginning of 1996. \
