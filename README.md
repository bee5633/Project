<b> Introduction </b> \
Since 2016 election, U.S. Border security has been a major subject of debate.

<b> Data </b> \
This data is originally collected by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) every quarter. 
Then it gets cleaned, assessed and maintained by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS).
